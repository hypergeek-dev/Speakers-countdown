A timer to help speakers in meetings keep track of shared time


The Speaker Timer is a simple JavaScript app that helps speakers stay on track during Zoom meetings. It provides a countdown timer that displays the remaining time for the speaker's presentation and alerts the speaker when there is one minute left. This notification signals the speaker to wind down their speech.

###Usage
To use the Speaker Timer, simply enter the desired presentation time in hours, minutes, and seconds. Then, click the Start button to begin the countdown timer. As the time elapses, the timer will update and display the remaining time. When there is one minute left, the app will display a message instructing the speaker to wind down their speech.

If the speaker needs more time, they can pause the timer by clicking the Pause button. When ready to resume, click the Resume button to continue the countdown from where it left off.

If the speaker needs to reset the timer, they can do so by clicking the Reset button. This will stop the timer and reset it to the original time entered.
